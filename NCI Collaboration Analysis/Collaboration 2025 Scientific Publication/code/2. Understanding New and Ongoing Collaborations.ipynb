    "\n",
    "This notebook is provided to meet the data availability requirements for a scientific publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is provided to meet the data availability requirements for a scientific publication. Data is derived from NIH's internal datasets and from Digital Science's Dimensions Platform. Data from Digital Science is based on metadata as of March 2024 from Digital Science's Dimensions platform, available at https://app.dimensions.ai/.  Access was granted under license agreement with the National Cancer Institute. Researchers interested in exploring the data further should visit the Dimensions platform website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps to answer the following 2 research questions:\n",
    "1) Did new collaborations form between 21st Century Cures Act funded investigators?  \n",
    "2) Did collaborations that began before 21st Century Cures Act funding persist with Cures Act funding support?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a series of notebooks on evaluating the impact of the 21st Century Cures Act on stimulating collaboration in the cancer research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Definitions:**\n",
    "- Cures Act PI Network: a network of investigators who were funded through the 21st Century Cures Act in FY 2017-2023.\n",
    "- New collaboration: a pairwise collaboration between PIs that began in or after the fiscal year during which at least one PI in the collaborative pair received 21st Century Cures Act funding.\n",
    "- Ongoing collaboration: a pairwise collaboration between PIs that occurred both before and after the fiscal year during which at least one PI in the collaborative pair received 21st Century Cures Act funding.â€¯ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Packages:**\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Input Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you used the filepaths recommended in Notebook 1. If you did not, be sure to change the input paths to the location where you saved the Cures Act PI Network nodes and aggregated edge tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Filepath 1: \"../data/cures_nodes.csv\"\n",
    "    - The nodes table for the Cures Act PI Network\n",
    "- Input Filepath 2: \"../data/cures_agg_edges.csv\"\n",
