    "This notebook is provided to meet the data availability requirements for a scientific publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is provided to meet the data availability requirements for a scientific publication. Data is derived from NIH's internal datasets and from Digital Science's Dimensions Platform. Data from Digital Science is based on metadata as of March 2024 from Digital Science's Dimensions platform, available at https://app.dimensions.ai/.  Access was granted under license agreement with the National Cancer Institute. Researchers interested in exploring the data further should visit the Dimensions platform website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to evaluate if there is a difference in the frequency of collaborative events among NCI funded PIs and 21st Century Cures Act PIs. It provides one form of evidence for answering the following research question: Did the number of collaborations among 21st Century Cures Act-supported investigators increase? \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a series of notebooks on evaluating the impact of the 21st Century Cures Act on stimulating collaboration in the cancer research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Definitions:**\n",
    "- NCI PI Network: a network of investigators who received qualifying funding from NCI in FY 2017-2023.\n",
    "- Cures Act PI Network: a network of investigators who were funded through the 21st Century Cures Act in FY 2017-2023.\n",
    "- Collaboration: A pairwise collaboration between two NCI supported PIs in the network. These form the edges of the network. Various edge count columns are available that describe the type and number of collaborations.\n",
    "- Collaborative Event: A measureable collaboration between NCI supported extramural investigators. Here, these are defined as NIH base projects OR publications (peer-reviewed articles OR conference proceedings/abstracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Packages:**\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Input Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you used the filepaths recommended in Notebook 1. If you did not, be sure to change the path to the cures_agg_edges.csv file to the filename and location where you saved the Cures Act PI Network aggregated edge table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Filepath 1: \"../data/collaboration_network/agg_edges.csv\"\n",
    "    - The aggregated edge table for the NCI PI Network\n",
    "- Input Filepath 2: \"../data/cures_agg_edges.csv\"\n",
