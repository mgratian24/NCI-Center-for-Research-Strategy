    "## 1. Building a Network of 21st Century Cures Act Funded PIs\n",

    "**About:** \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is provided to meet the data availability requirements for a scientific publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is provided to meet the data availability requirements for a scientific publication. Data is derived from NIH's internal datasets and from Digital Science's Dimensions Platform. Data from Digital Science is based on metadata as of March 2024 from Digital Science's Dimensions platform, available at https://app.dimensions.ai/.  Access was granted under license agreement with the National Cancer Institute. Researchers interested in exploring the data further should visit the Dimensions platform website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces two tables that together form a network of NCI supported extramural investigators, which we call the \"NCI PI Network\". This notebook demonstrates how fields in the tables can be used to produce a subset of the NCI PI Network that represents the PIs funded through the 21st Century Cures Act, referred to as the \"Cures Act PI Network\" in this notebook and subsequent ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a series of notebooks on evaluating the impact of the 21st Century Cures Act on stimulating collaboration in the cancer research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Definitions:**\n",
    "- NCI supported: indicates NCI extramural funding (grants).\n",
    "- 21st Century Cures Act supported: indicates extramural funding through the 21st Century Cures Act.\n",
    "- NCI PI Network: a network of investigators who received qualifying funding from NCI in FY 2017-2023.\n",
    "- Cures Act PI Network: a network of investigators who were funded through the 21st Century Cures Act in FY 2017-2023.\n",
    "- PI: an NCI supported extramural investigator. These form the nodes of the network. \n",
    "- Collaboration: A pairwise collaboration between two NCI supported PIs in the network. These form the edges of the network. Various edge count columns are available that describe the type and number of collaborations.\n",
    "- Collaborative Event: A measureable collaboration between NCI supported extramural investigators. Here, these are defined as NIH base projects OR publications (peer-reviewed articles OR conference proceedings/abstracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Packages:**\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Input Files:**\n",
    "- Input Filepath 1: \"../data/collaboration_network/nodes.csv\"\n",
    "    - The nodes table for the NCI PI Network\n",
    "- Input Filepath 2: \"../data/collaboration_network/agg_edges.csv\"\n",
    "    - The aggregated edge table for the NCI PI Network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Output Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend saving the tables produced in this notebook with the following paths and filenames. Subsequent notebooks will use these tables for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output Filepath 1: \"../data/cures_nodes.csv\"\n",
    "    - A nodes table containing NIH PIs who received 21st Century Cures Act funding in FY 2017-2023.\n",
    "- Output Filepath 2: \"../data/cures_agg_edges.csv\"\n",
    "    - An aggregated edge table containing publication and project collaborations among NIH PIs who received 21st Century Cures Act funding in FY 2017-2023."
