    "# Using the RePORTER API\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook and the request_reporter module were developed by Margaret Gratian with support from the NIH RePORTER team.*\n",
    "________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrate how to use the request_reporter module to request NIH award data from RePORTER.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook relies on a simple custom package called reporter and its request_reporter module. The module has functions for requesting data from the RePORTER API and getting back results structured as a Pandas DataFrame. This module is not comprehensive of all RePORTER API functionality and instead can be thought of as a starting point for further development. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reporter package must be located in the same directory as this notebook in order for this notebook to run correctly. If you move the reporter directory location, you will need to adjust the structure of the import below to tell Python where to find the package, as this is not a published package available in the Python Package Index.\n",
